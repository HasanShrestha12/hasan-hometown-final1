       <li> Lifestyle</li>
       <p>Kathmandu is one of the few city that are almost open to western culture and socially acceptable. The locals are open to other cultures. Young generations are keen on foreign lifestyle and knowledge so it can always be a good idea to have a chat with them whilst around. People in Kathmandu fairly speak good english. 

<p>p.s : We guarantee you that you will crave a plate of MOMO once you leave Nepal :D. Please do try MOMO while your stay in Nepal and other amazing local foods. Do ask us we are enthusiast about Food and we can recommend some great locations for authentic Nepalese food.</P>

       <li>  Mountaineering</li>
       <p>All mountaineering adventure in Nepal first begins through Kathmandu. Nepal has only one international airport, so you won't be able to escape Kathmandu and all your permits and documentation are processed here too. All adventurers arriving in Nepal stays 1 or 2 days in the capital to recoup from their jet lag or acclimatise and then head towards their chosen expedition. 

<p>So if you have plans like climbing Mount Everest, Baruntse peak any adventures in the Everest or Makalu region or further on the west to Mount Manaslu or Himlung Himal mountain any adventures in the Annapurna or Dhaulagiri region then Kathmandu is your initial or final destination.</p>
